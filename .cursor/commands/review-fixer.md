# review-fixer

Triage GitHub Copilot and Cursor Bugbot review comments using the project AI review policy. Fix high-risk findings and
in-budget nits; dismiss the rest; at most one follow-up issue.

When a PR is known, process **open** work only: unresolved AI threads plus findings in the latest Copilot/Bugbot review
body that have no thread (including Copilot “Suppressed comments”). Do not re-triage resolved threads. Reply and resolve
threads when `gh` can; for summary-only items, comment on the PR conversation instead.

**Input:** PR number or URL, optional review permalink, or pasted comments.

**Steps**

1. Read and follow `.agents/skills/review-fixer/SKILL.md`.
2. Use `docs/ai_review_policy.md` as the decision source of truth.
3. If a PR is known: fetch once, triage open work only, reply/resolve as the skill specifies.
4. Do not commit or push unless the user asks.
